# Housing Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing housing data to identify trends and clean datasets for further analysis and visualization. The project uses:
- Python for data processing and integration.
- SQL for data cleaning and database queries.
- A housing dataset (`housing_data.csv`) as the primary data source.

## Files in the Repository
- **main.py:** A Python script to:
  - Load and process the housing dataset.
  - Clean the data and prepare it for analysis.
  - Integrate cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.
- **DataCleaning.sql:** SQL queries used to clean and transform the dataset in the database.
- **housing_data.csv:** The raw housing dataset used for analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- **Python 3.x** with the following libraries:
  - pandas
  - psycopg2
  - SQLAlchemy
- **PostgreSQL** for database integration and query execution.
- A modern IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
